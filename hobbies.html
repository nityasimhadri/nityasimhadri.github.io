											<h3>Carrot Cake with Halva Frosting</h3>
											<p> This recipe definitely threw me for a loop when I first came across it because the key ingredient: Baby Food! Lanibakes' carrot cake recipie features all the normal ingredients: cinnamon, walnuts and nutmeg but the real flavor and texture comes from pureed carrots (yup baby food!). The cake is topped with a halva frosting made out of tahini (a personal favorite), a drizzle of strawberry jam frosting and some freeze dried strawberries with edible roses! </p>

											<h3>Black Sesame Brownies</h3>
											<p>I had been wanting to make black brownies for a while so when I found a jar of a black sesame butter, I figured it was the perfect opportnity. I topped the brownies with a dark chocolate frosting and some sesame seeds. In all honesty, I cannot say this was a crowd favorite and the brownies did taste a little like dirt. Regardless, it was super fun to experiment with a new food and they still ended up looking pretty cool!</p>

											<h3>Winter Hazelnut Cake</h3>
											<p>Out of all the cakes Iâ€™ve posted, this cake takes the cake! As an engineer, I decided to take an engineering approach to this one and drew out all the components before. And let me tell you, every component from the butter cream to the crunchy hazelnut and the fresh crisp berries shined through this cake. Completed with the iconic Ferrero Rochers and a sprinkle of pomegranate, this was the perfect winter cake to help get through the negative temps!</p>

										<h3>Chocolate Cake with Tahini Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
										<p>For my 21st birthday, I knew I wanted to make a cake and I knew I wanted to play with unique flavors. After serious digging I settled on making a tahini (sesame butter) flavored cake. I made a rich chocolate cake base, layered with a tahini caramel and toffee chunks, topped with the tahini cream cheese frosting and candied blood oranges (that took me two whole days to make)! The flavor profile of this cake was truly one of my favorites and definitely one to try out! </p>
										
										<h3>Grapefruit Bars</h3>
										<p>When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade and when life gives you grapefruits, you make.. you guessed it - Grapefruit Bars! I truly think I go through a box of trader joes lemon bars a week so when I had a couple grapefruits left over I decided to see how they would compare. These grapefruit bars taste surprisngly similar to lemon bars, only slightly less sour and a little sweeter.   </p>

										<h3>Fruit Tart and Oreo Peanut Butter Pie</h3>
										<p> My peanut butter and fruit tart loving roommate's 21st called for not one but two delicous desserts! On the left we have a fruit tart filled with egg custard, topped with berries. And to satisfy her peanut butter addiction, I made her a peanut butter pie with an oreo crust, peanut butter filling and chocolate fudge topping.  </p>

										<h3>When life gives you clementines ... you make clementine cake!</h3>
										<p> During a relaxing weekend at my aunt's home in San Diego, I spent most of my time circling around their gorgeous clementine tree. The clementines were the juiciest and sweetest citrus ever, so of course I *had* to steal a good handful and bring them home with me. This cake used every inch of the clementine from slices at the bottom, zest infused into the sugar and I sealed the deal by throwing in the clementine juice into the batter. This cake turned out incredible and if you are a citrus lover this is a must try!  </p>
